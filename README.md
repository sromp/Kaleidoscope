# Kaleidoscope

This is a toy language, where I'm following https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend and making my own adjustments.

To build this, you must have LLVM installed. The version I'm using is 14.0.6. You must also have CMake installed. I'm using 3.22.2. After that, running build.bat and run.bat should be enough to build and run.
